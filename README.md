DC-motor-movement

Project Description:
This project aims to control the movement of two DC motors using an L293D controller and an Arduino board. Specific movements are performed such as moving forward and backward, as well as rotating right and left alternately. This project can be used as a basis for building a small robot or a smart car.

Components used:
- Arduino board
- L293D motor controller
- Two DC motors
- Connecting wires

How to use:
1. Connect the motors to the L293D according to the electrical circuit
2. Upload the code to the Arduino board
3. Turn on the system and you will notice the execution of the specified movements (forward, backward, right, left)
